## FAQ

**What frameworks are supported?**  
Core logic is engineered for QBCore/QBX with AJD Bridge handling inventory/target calls. ESX is not supported in this package.

**Can I disable heat or police for casual servers?**  
Yes. Every subsystem (heat, evidence, dispatch) can be toggled or tuned per zone or globally.

**Can cops use the system too?**  
You can script undercover events or sting operations by checking job, gang, or item flags before sales.

**Does it work with ox_target / qb-target?**  
AJD Bridge exposes both target systems, so you can choose your preferred UI/interaction flow.

**What about custom drugs or items?**  
Add them to `Config.AllowedItems`, set price multipliers per zone, and plug in unique heat effects or loyalty bonuses.
